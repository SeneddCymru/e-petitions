        <h1 class="page-title">How petitions work</h1>

        <ol class="list-number">
          <li>You create a petition. Only British citizens and UK residents can create a petition.</li>
          <li>You get 5 people to support your petition. We’ll tell you how to do this when you’ve created your petition.</li>
          <li>We check your petition, then publish it. We only reject petitions that don’t meet the standards for petitions.</li>
          <li>British citizens and UK residents can then sign your petition — and can only sign a petition once.</li>
          <li>The Petitions Committee reviews all petitions we publish. They select petitions of interest to find out more about the issues raised. They have the power to press for action from government or Parliament.</li>
          <li>At 10,000 signatures you get a response from the government.</li>
          <li>At 100,000 signatures your petition will be considered for a debate in Parliament.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="debates">Debates</h2>

        <p>Petitions which reach 100,000 signatures are almost always debated. But we may decide not to put a petition forward for debate if the issue has already been debated recently or there’s a debate scheduled for the near future. If that’s the case, we’ll tell you how you can find out more about parliamentary debates on the issue raised by your petition.</p>

        <p>MPs might consider your petition for a debate before it reaches 100,000 signatures.</p>

        <p>We may contact you about the issue covered by your petition. For example, we sometimes invite people who create petitions to take part in a discussion with MPs or government ministers, or to give evidence to a select committee. We may also write to other people or organisations to ask them about the issue raised by your petition.</p>

        <h2 id="petitions-committee">The Petitions Committee</h2>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/petitions-committee">Petitions Committee</a> can:</p>

        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>write to you for more information</li>
          <li>invite you to talk to the Committee in person about your petition – this could be in Parliament or somewhere else in the UK</li>
          <li>ask for evidence from the Government or other relevant people or organisations</li>
          <li>press the government for action</li>
          <li>ask another parliamentary committee to look into the topic raised by a petition</li>
          <li>put forward a petition for debate</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Petitions Committee is set up by the Welsh Parliament. It comprises up to 11 backbench Members of Parliament from Government and Opposition parties. The number of committee members from each political party is representative of the membership of the Welsh Parliament as a whole.</p>

        <h2 id="standards">Standards for petitions</h2>

        <p>Petitions must call for a specific action from the Welsh Government or Parliament.</p>

        <p>Petitions must be about something that the Government or Parliament is responsible for.</p>

        <p>Petitions can disagree with the Government and can ask for it to change its policies. Petitions can be critical of the Welsh Government or Parliament.</p>

        <p>We reject petitions that don’t meet the rules. If we reject your petition, we’ll tell you why. If we can, we’ll suggest other ways you could raise your issue.</p>

        <p>We’ll have to reject your petition if:</p>

        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>
            <p>It calls for the same action as a petition that’s already open</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It doesn’t ask for a clear action from the Welsh Government or Parliament</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It’s about something the Welsh Government or Parliament is not responsible for.</p>
            <p>That includes: something that your local council is responsible for; something that another Government (such as the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government or the Northern Ireland Executive) is responsible for; and something that an independent organisation has done.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It’s defamatory or libellous, or contains false statements</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It refers to a case that’s active in the UK courts</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It contains material that may be protected by an injunction or court order</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It contains material that could be confidential or commercially sensitive</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It could cause personal distress or loss. This includes petitions that could intrude into someone’s personal grief or shock without their consent.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It accuses an identifiable person or organisation of a crime</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It names individual officials of public bodies, unless they are senior managers</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It names family members of elected representatives, eg MPs, or of officials of public bodies</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It asks for someone to be given an honour, or have an honour taken away. You can nominate someone for an honour here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/honours">www.gov.uk/honours</a></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It asks for someone to be given a job, or to lose their job. This includes petitions asking for a vote of no confidence in someone and petitions calling for someone to resign.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It contains party political material</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It’s nonsense or a joke</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It’s an advert, spam, or promotes a specific product or service</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It’s a Freedom of Information request</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It contains swearing or other offensive language</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It’s offensive or extreme in its views. That includes petitions that attack, criticise or negatively focus on an individual or a group of people because of characteristics such as their age, disability, ethnic origin, gender identity, medical condition, nationality, race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We publish the text of petitions that we reject, as long as they’re not:</p>
        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>defamatory, libellous or illegal in another way;</li>
          <li>about a case that is active in the UK courts or about something that a court has issued an injunction over;</li>
          <li>offensive or extreme;</li>
          <li>confidential or likely to cause personal distress. That includes petitions that could intrude into someone’s personal grief or shock without their consent; or</li>
          <li>a joke, an advert or nonsense.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="recall">Recall petitions</h2>

        <p>If an MP has been convicted of certain criminal offences or suspended from Parliament for at least 10 sitting days, they may be subject to a recall petition.</p>

        <p>Petitions to recall Members of Parliament do not appear on this website and the Petitions Committee are not responsible for them.
          They are run locally, by the returning officer for your area, and have to be signed in person, by post or proxy. Your local authority will have issued a “notice of recall petition” on their website.
          This will tell you how and when you can sign the petition.</p>

          <h2 id="privacy-heading">Privacy notice: how we use your data</h2>

          <p>Last update: January 6 2020</p>

          <p>The Petitions site lets you start and sign petitions to raise issues with the Welsh Parliament.</p>

          <p>The Petitions service is provided by the Parliament. We need to collect, process and store some personal data to enable you to do this.</p>

          <p>A data controller determines how and why personal data is processed. The Welsh Parliament is the data controller of this site.</p>

          <p>The data controller for Parliament is the Clerk of the House.</p>

          <h3>What data we collect from you</h3>

          <p>The personal data we collect from people who start and sign petitions will include:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>your name</li>
            <li>your email address</li>
            <li>your postcode</li>
            <li>the country you live in</li>
            <li>whether you are a British citizen</li>
            <li>the IP address you use when starting or signing a petition</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The legal basis for processing this data is public task – allowing you to raise issues with the Welsh Parliament.</p>

          <h3>Why we need your data</h3>

          <p>We use this information to:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>make sure that people only sign a petition once</li>
            <li>check that you’re eligible to sign a petition</li>
            <li>contact you about petitions you start</li>
            <li>if you consent, email you updates about what happens in Parliament petitions you’ve signed</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What we do with your data</h3>

          <p>If you start a petition and we accept it, your name will be published with the petition. We won’t publish any other personal information about you.</p>

          <p>If you’ve signed a petition, we won’t publish any personal information about you.</p>

          <p>We’ll use your postcode to work out how many people in each parliamentary constituency have signed a petition.</p>

          <p>We will not:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
            <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We will share your data if we’re required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

          <h3>What we’ll email you about</h3>

          <p>If a petition you’ve started or signed gets a response from the Government, we’ll email the response to you.</p>

          <p>If you’ve started or signed a petition, we might contact you to let you know about relevant things that are happening in Parliament and Government. That might include: debates that you can watch or read, chances to respond to a consultation, or ways to let MPs know why the petition is important to you.</p>

          <p>You can stop these emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the email.</p>

          <h3>How long we keep your data</h3>

          <p>We will retain your personal data from the date you start or sign a petition, until 6 months after that petition closes – a maximum of 12 months in total.</p>

          <h3>Where your data is processed and stored</h3>

          <p>We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.</p>

          <p>All personal data on Petitions is processed, stored and managed entirely in the European Economic Area (EEA), and will not be transferred outside of it. This means that it is covered by EU Data Protection regulations.</p>

          <h3>How we protect your data and keep it secure</h3>

          <p>We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.
