Feature: Suzy Signer views all petitions
  In order to find interesting petitions to sign for a particular area of government
  As Suzy the signer
  I want to look through all the petitions

  Scenario: Suzie can't see the closing date from the index page if no petitions are collecting signatures

     | Make every monday bank holiday                      |
     | Force supermarkets to give unsold food to charities |
